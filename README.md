# Sahar
Sahar is a simple framework written in [Moonscript](http://moonscript.org/) atop of [Löve](https://love2d.org/) engine.

The word **Sahar** stands for *Moon* in hebrew (סַהַר). It's clearly a reference to Lua and Moonscript, but in hebrew just because I like it! :D
Sahar is a framework whose objective is to simplify yet more the work of making a game with Löve. It automatizes a few things and turn it all the OO way that Moonscript works, making it much easier to develop a game.

## How to use **Sahar**:
We assume that you are already familiarized with *Moonscript*.
You just have to *require* Sahar whenever you want to use it, and all the library will be immediately available!

	require 'Sahar'
	
	-- Game code goes here
	

A little all-inclusive example is in the repository.

Could it be simplier? Hell no! :D
