# Sahar
Sahar is a simple framework written in Moonscript atop of Löve engine.

The word **Sahar** stands for *Moon* in hebrew (סַהַר). It's clearly a reference to Lua and Moonscript, but in hebrew just because I like it! :D
Sahar is a framework whose objective is to simplify yet more the work of making a game with Löve. It automatizes a few things and turn it all the OO way that Moonscript works, making it much easier to program a game.
